[We're happy to announce that the first 6 levels of Tonalities are now available to play on Steam Early Access](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2265750?utm=gameful).

We're massively grateful to everyone who tried the demo and gave us valuable feedback. It's been as massive help as we have been working hard on improving the quality of Tonalities since July.

On a personal level, I'm massively proud to have released a game on Steam and will be working hard to ensure that the game continues to grow in quality during its Early Access run.

We want the development process to be a collaborative effort between us and the players. So if you have any comments/suggestions, [please do share them in the discussion forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2265750/discussions/0/3811785047380607249/).

Until next time!

Jared
