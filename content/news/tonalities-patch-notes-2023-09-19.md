It's been 2 weeks since the initial early access of [Tonalities on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2265750/Tonalities/) so it's time for the first batch of quality of life improvements.

Many thanks to everyone who's tried out the game at this early stage. Your feedback and support is massively appreciated, this latest version includes the following updates:

- It is now possible to quickly reset levels by either pressing the space bar or by clicking the right mouse button.
- Added a trail to the ball to make it easier to line up future shots.
- Fixed an issue with the Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes achievement to ensure it triggers.
- Updated the pause menu to make all main settings accessible in-game.
- Created a new layout for the level select page.

Additionally, I've been working behind-the-scenes to improve the build pipeline for the project new features will be deployed to the PC, Mac and Linux versions of the game simultaneously which will help speed up deployment of future versions to Steam. 

This doesn't affect you, but it makes my life easier! :)
