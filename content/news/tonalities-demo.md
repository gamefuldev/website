[We're happy to announce that the first 3 levels of Tonalities are now available to try on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2265750?utm=gameful).

We're very excited to share the game with you and hope you enjoy trying out the first collection of puzzles. If you have any comments/suggestions, [please do share them in the discussion forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2265750/discussions/0/3811785047380607249/).

If you enjoy the demo, please remember to add Tonalities to your Wishlist on Steam. It really helps us out!

Cheers!
