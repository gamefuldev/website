After releasing last month, I'm proud to share that in addition to being available through Steam Early Access, "Tonalities" has also been featured as part of the Overcome Film Festival Game Awards 2023.

It's an honour to have my small indie project showcased among such talented developers and amazing games.

Thanks to everyone who's picked up a copy and helped me on this journey.
