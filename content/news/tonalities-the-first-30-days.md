"Without 10000 wishlists your game will be dead in the water!", have said many a poster on [/r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/). Without a sound marketing plan and an established audience it will be an uphill battle to get much traction on the Steam market place.

Tonalities started as a game jam passion project that slowly got out of hand. It's been a game I've been plugged away at during evenings and weekend for a few months when things aren't too hectic at my day job. So I did go into things with fairly muted expectations. 

For my studio's first release, I set only a few modest goals for myself to use to measure the game's success:

- Learn enough about the Steamworks platform to be able actually build and deploy a game on Steam.
- Sell enough copies to make back the Steam Direct game registration fee.
- The game should have more positive than negative reviews

The game initially released on the 6th of September without any prior marketed (save for me posting a few GIFs on Twitter/X sporadically).

Would I be able to reach my success criteria by giving the game 30 days of marketing push? Let's find out!

## Week 1

### Day 1 - Get eyes on the prize

The game wasn't selling because no-one knows that it exists. The first step towards selling the game would surely be to get as many new eyeballs on the project as possible. I posted about our recent release on the following websites:

- Reddit /r/indiegames: https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/16ceoqz/our_physics_puzzle_game_tonalities_has_just/
- LinkedIn (Indie Games Developer Group): https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7105374519405461504/

I also used this day to make use of the Steam Curator Connect Program. I sent out copies of Tonalities to 60 different curators for them to try. I look forward to hearing what they have to say.
