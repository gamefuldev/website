"Without 10000 wishlists your game will be dead in the water!", have said many a poster on [/r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/). Without a sound marketing plan and an established audience it will be an uphill battle to get much traction on the Steam market place.

Tonalities started as a game jam passion project that slowly got out of hand. It's been a game I've been plugging away at during evenings and weekend for a few months when things aren't too hectic at the day job. So I did go into things with fairly muted expectations.

For my studio's first release, I set only a few modest goals for myself to use to measure the game's success:

- Learn enough about the Steamworks platform to be able actually build and deploy a game on Steam.
- Sell enough copies to make back the Steam Direct game registration fee.
- The game should have more positive than negative reviews

The game initially released on the 6th of September without any prior marketed (save for me posting a few GIFs on Twitter/X sporadically).

Would I be able to reach my success criteria by giving the game 30 days of marketing push? Let's find out!

## Week 1

### Day 1 - Running total: 8 units sold / 1 unit refunded

The game wasn't selling because no-one knows that it exists. The first step towards selling the game would surely be to get as many new eyeballs on the project as possible. I posted about our recent release on the following websites:

- Reddit /r/indiegames: https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/16ceoqz/our_physics_puzzle_game_tonalities_has_just/
- LinkedIn (Indie Games Developer Group): https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7105374519405461504/

I also used this day to make use of the Steam Curator Connect Program. I sent out copies of Tonalities to 60 different curators for them to try. I look forward to hearing what they have to say.

### Day 2 - Running total: 9 units sold / 2 units refunded

During our second day of release I spent some time reflecting on feedback from the early player base. I was sent some really useful feedback on some quick win quality of life suggestions that I decided to put to the top of the list for the v2023.09.17 update.

In terms of marketing, Tonalities received a user review and a curator review (both recommending the game) so we'll have to wait and see if that will push us up higher into the Steam algorithm or not.

In terms of marketing, I tried to participate in #FollowFriday on X/Twitter to encourage more people to try the game but with a small following and an unwillingness to pay Elon for a blue tick I think the effectiveness of this approach will be pretty negligible. A better plan is needed, and to try to remedy this I took some time to watch [Michelle Lega's No-Budget DIY Marketing for Indie Games video from this year's GDC conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWyZlGMysH8).

Learn today, market more tomorrow!

### Day 3 - Running total: 9 units sold / 2 units refunded

- Took part in screenshot saturday
- Wrote a press release and sent it to Indie DB and Games Press
- Spent time improving the copy on the steam page and itch.io pages

### Day 4 - Running total: 10 units sold / 2 units refunded

- I spent time on Reddit having discussions with other indie game devs in /r/gamedev, to try to gain insights from them about how they try to market their games.
- Responded to a post from the indie diarist podcast host Anthony about the difficulties indie developers face when trying to market a game. From there I decided to reach out to him directly to see if I could share my story from Tonalities on his podcast.

### Day 5 - Running total: 10 units sold / 2 units refunded

Had a lovely email exchange with Anthony at the Indie Diarist and set a tentative date of November 10th to appear on his show and discuss the podcast. Updated all of the screenshots on the Steam store page with newer and shinier examples.
